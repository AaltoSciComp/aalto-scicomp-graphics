Logo
----

Logos created using Inkscape - use that to edit.  The logo fonts are
Nimbus Sans, not how to make sure it is editable across other systems.

``logo-dev``: master file we are using to iterate.  Note that it has
*many* layers, turn them off and on to experiment.

More files will be added later once we have a decision on what to use.
